      "prompt": "Generate a summary of the following passage in all capital letters:\n\nWorld War II or the Second World War, often abbreviated as WWII or WW2, was a global conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945. The vast majority of the world's countries, including all of the great powers, fought as part of two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. Many participants threw their economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind this total war, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war. World War II was by far the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in an estimated 70 to 85 million fatalities, mostly among civilians. Tens of millions died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of Axis defeat, Germany, Austria and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.\n\n",
      "response": "The Soviet Union emerged as a global superpower in the process. The United States emerged as the strongest power in the world, with the first nuclear weapons and the largest economy. The United Kingdom, France, China, and Canada were also among the big five major Allied powers. The Second Red Scare resulted in anti-communist witch-hunts in the U.S. and other countries. The establishment of the state of Israel and the partitioning of Palestine resulted in the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict. The Cold War was the ongoing geopolitical tension after World War II between the Soviet Union with its satellite states and the allied nations of the Western Bloc, dominated by the United States. The resulting political tensions and military confrontations between the two sides ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nThe causes of World War II are debated. The most widely accepted theory is that Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party of Germany were the main cause of the war. Hitler's aggressive foreign policy, a desire to regain territory and resources taken from Germany after World War I, along with a desire to dominate Europe, led to the invasion of Poland in 1939. The Soviet Union, under Joseph Stalin, was also a major cause of the war. Stalin's desire to expand Soviet influence and control over Eastern Europe, along with his desire to regain territory and resources taken from Russia after the Russian Revolution, led to the invasion of Finland in 1939 and the invasion of Poland in 1939. The United States, under Franklin D. Roosevelt, was also a major cause of the war. Roosevelt's desire to expand American influence and control over the world, along with his desire to regain territory and resources taken from the United States after the American Revolution, led to the invasion of Japan in 1941.\n\nThe war ended with the surrender of Germany in May 1945 and the surrender of Japan in September 1945. The war was a major turning point in world history, leading to the end of the European colonial empires and the rise of the United States and the Soviet Union as the two superpowers of the post-war world. The war also led to the creation of the United Nations, which was established in 1945 to promote international cooperation and prevent future wars.\n\nThe war also had a major impact on the world economy, leading to the creation of the Bretton Woods system, which was established in 1944 to regulate international trade and finance. The war also led to the creation of the International Monetary Fund, which was established in 1945 to provide financial assistance to countries in need. The war also led to the creation of the World Bank, which was established in 1945 to provide loans to developing countries.\n\nThe war also had a major impact on the world's population, leading to the creation of the United Nations Population Fund, which was established in 1945 to promote population control and family planning. The war also led to the creation of the United Nations Children's Fund, which was established in 1946 to provide aid to children in need.\n\nThe war also had a major impact on the world's environment, leading to the creation of the United Nations Environment Programme, which was established in 1972 to promote environmental protection and sustainable development. The war also led to the creation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was established in 1992 to address the issue of climate change.\n\nThe war also had a major impact on the world's culture, leading to the creation of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, which was established in 1945 to promote international cooperation in education, science and culture. The war also led to the creation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which was established in 1951 to provide assistance to refugees and displaced persons.\n\nThe war also had a major impact on the world's economy, leading to the creation of the World Trade Organization, which was established in 1995 to promote international trade and investment. The war also led to the creation of the International Criminal Court, which was established in 2002 to prosecute individuals accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.\n\nThe war also had a major impact on the world's politics, leading to the creation of the United Nations Security Council, which was established in 1945 to maintain international peace and security. The war also led to the creation of the United Nations General Assembly, which was established in 1945 to discuss and vote on issues of international importance.\n\nThe war also had a major impact on the world's religion, leading to the creation of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations, which was established in 2005 to promote interfaith dialogue and understanding. The war also led to the creation of the United Nations Human Rights Council, which was established in 2006 to promote and protect human rights worldwide.\n\nThe war also had a major impact on the world's health, leading to the creation of the United Nations World Health Organization, which was established in 1948 to promote health and well-being worldwide. The war also led to the creation of",

Entanglement is an important concept in entangled-state quantum cryptography, which provides an unconditionally secure way of transmitting messages. Entanglement is also an important resource in quantum teleportation, quantum computation, superdense coding, and several algorithms such as Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, Grover's algorithm, and Shor's algorithm.\n\n## History\n\nThe first people to discuss entanglement were Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen in their paper describing the EPR paradox in 1935. They began by discussing the incompleteness of the wave function, which they believed could be remedied by adding hidden variables. They then described the paradox, which they felt revealed the impossibility of such a completion. They argued that if quantum mechanics were correct, one would be able to send signals infinitely fast, which Einstein believed to be impossible.\n\nIn 1935, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger wrote a paper discussing the EPR paradox and the idea of entanglement. He coined the German word Verschr\u00e4nkung (meaning \"entanglement\", \"superposition\", or \"linkage\") to name the idea, and gave the now famous example of the two black cats in boxes. He also discussed the idea of entanglement in the paper, but only in relation to the EPR paradox.\n\nIn 1944, David Bohm published a paper that proposed a thought experiment that demonstrated that quantum entanglement could be used to violate Bell's inequality, which limits the results of measurements of pairs of entangled particles.
